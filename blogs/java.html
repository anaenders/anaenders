  <p>(Nerd alert!) <strong>Introduction to Java:</strong> complete! <strong>Intermediate Java:</strong> complete!</p>
  <p>Weekly courses from January through May got me these certificates. I'm also happy to report that I scored 95% and 94% on my finals!</p>
  <p>The reason I did this was to get a basic understanding of the fundamentals of object oriented programming. Not sure that I want to take it further than 'Intermediate' but it was fun and the sense of accomplishment having completed these courses was fantastic.</p>
