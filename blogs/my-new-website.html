  <p>Welcome to my new and improved site!</p>
  <p>You might recall my previous site having more pages and more personal content. This site will be more focused on career. The About page is primarily a resume and the Portfolio page lists my works. I kept the blog page since I occasionally feel the need to share my thoughts with anyone willing to read.</p>
  <p>Click around and have a look.</p> 
  <p>Cheers!</p>
