  <p>I'm fast tracking to present times and summing up three month's of my life in this little post. Too much has happened and time flies. In short, I moved from two east coast cities (New York & Toronto) to one west coast city (San Francisco).</p>

  <p>San Francisco has its pros and cons, but the cons can be avoided with some planning. I love that out here I don't have to face the brutality of winter. It does get chilly, but it will never be the near-death numbing cold that I've put up with for too long in the east coast. Simple walks around my neighborhood offer magnificent awe inspiring views of the bay with sailboat scattered on the blue ocean; islands and the Golden Gate bridge as their backdrop. The air is fresh and the sights at every street intersection offer unreal and beautiful panoramas of city and nature juxtaposed.</p>

  <p>So.... yes, I'm happy out here, so long as I keep my distance from questionable neighborhoods (i.e. The Tenderloin, parts of Western Addition, and so on). I've spent a lot of my time here adjusting. First with the multi-part move, now with errands and tasks that I will not have time for once I start working full time. I'm also in the process of redesign my website and am taking my time learning new things along the way in preparation for my inevitable job interviews. It is definitely a challenge getting one's life in order but I can't complain, despite being busy this is the most relaxed I've felt in a long time (especially with the wedding, the honeymoon, the packing, the moving, the apartment search - all happening back to back from September until now). Compared to the last few crazy months, recently life has felt like an extended vacation.</p>
  
  <p>Next post I will have a new and improved site. Stay tuned.</p>
