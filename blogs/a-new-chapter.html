  <p>If you've been keeping up with the life and times of Ana, you would probably have noticed that the past year has been crazy non stop action for myself and Ian; It has been both exciting and exhausting.</p>
  <p>My latest endeavor was to find the "perfect" job. As is always the case for me when job searching, I use the word "perfect" to mean an awesome opportunity presented at precisely the right moment; a job I am destined for. And it so happened that an awesome opportunity came along at precisely the right time. So I now hold a position as the Senior Frontend Engineer with <a href="http://www.themuse.com/" target="_blank">The Muse</a>. I'm excited to be working with such an excellent group of people. Their mission is to help women in their careers by writing smart articles, provide insightful advice, and having an engaging job board showcasing the culture of the companies as opposed to just focusing on the position these companies would like to fill.</p>
  <p>I promised myself that I would have to celebrate my new found job by waiting until my first paycheck to purchase a new set of dining chairs, which I've been dying to do for the longest time. With my new set of dining chairs I will have officially completed my move and my home will at last be fully furnished.</p> 
  <p>I feel like such an adult!</p>
