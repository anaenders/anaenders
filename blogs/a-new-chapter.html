  <p>If you've been keeping up with the life and times of Ana, you would probably have noticed that the past year has been crazy non stop action for myself and Ian; It has been both exciting and exhausting.</p>
  <p>My latest endeavor was to find the "perfect" job. I had to readjust my definition of perfect a few times before being able to truly analyze my prospects and to realize that the right opportunity was within my reach. So I reached, grabbed, and now hold a fancy job as a frontend developer with <a href="www.thedailymuse.com">The Daily Muse</a>. I'm pretty psyched about working with such an excellent group of ladies. Their mission is to help women in their careers by writing smart articles, providing insightful advice, and having an engaging job board. My contribution will come in the form of designing and coding for their job board, <a href="http://companies.thedailymuse.com/">The Company Muse</a>, and as needed for the main site.</p>
  <p>I promised myself that I would have to celebrate my new found job by waiting until my first paycheck to purchase a new set of dining chairs, which I've been dying to do for the longest time. With my new set of dining chairs I will have officially completed my move and my home will at last be fully furnished.</p> 
  <p>I feel like such an adult!</p>
