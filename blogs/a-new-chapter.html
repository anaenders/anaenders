  <p>As some of you know, the past year has been crazy non stop action for us. It has been both exciting and exhausting.</p>
  <p>My latest endeavor was to find an awesome job. Waiting for serendipity and  opportunity to cross my path. And so I now hold an awesome postion as the Senior Frontend Engineer with <a href="http://www.themuse.com/" target="_blank">The Muse</a>. I'm excited to be working with such an excellent group of people. Their mission is to help people find their dream jobs and excel at their careers. The Muse provides insightful advice, showcases company culture, and lists amazing jobs for these companies.</p>
  <p>I promised myself that I would have to celebrate my new found job by waiting until my first paycheck to purchase a new set of dining chairs, which I've been dying to do for the longest time. With my new set of dining chairs I will have officially completed my move and my home will at last be fully furnished.</p> 
  <p>Yay me!</p>
