  <p>Hello there. It's been a while, I know. 409 days since my last post, to be precise. Yikes.</p>
  <p>Well, the good news is, my site is recently responsive. Meaning you can read all my rarely posted posts on mobile!</p>
  <p>In other news, it's Spring!</p>
  <p>This is very exciting for me. See, we moved back to NYC during my 409 day hiatus here, and one of the things I was most anxious about was winter (one can experience decades of east coast winters but it only takes one west coast winter-less year to destroy any endurance you might have had to the cold). As I feared, it sucked. A lot. But winter is over! Butters and I couldn't be happier. Ian won't admit to having been miserable (his Canadian pride won't allow it), but I know he too is happy that spring has sprung!</p>
  <p>I'm trying to think of notable activities worth mentioning since my last visit here. Oh! I'm pretty proud of myself for having made my very first oil painting! Last time I painted anything, I was 10. It was a still-life in watercolor, and it was shitty. So you can imagine my surprise at actually painting something worth hanging up! I've run out of wall space so I can't continue the hobby, but it's nice to know I have the skillz yo!</p>
  <p>Check it! (On the right is mine, left is Ian's masterpiece. Bottom is Butters being cute <img alt='pic' src='/images/blog/heart.png' />)</p>
