  <p>Turns out Ian has hidden talents.</p>
  <p>Coincidentally, these talents reveal themselves during moments of relationship damage control, or on special occasions, i.e. anniversaries, Valentines Day etc. It's always a pleasant surprise to see what he will pull out of his sleeve, but that he strategically holds back ...Sneaky Sneaky... </p>
  <p>This year, Valentine's Day exposed Ian's hidden talent for making Bok Choi Miso Soup with Dumplings, no assistance required. So I stood there, mouth agape, watching Ian put together a meal; the very same man who has trouble brewing a pot of coffee and who only ever visits the refrigerator to grab a beer (occasionally water).</p>
  <p>Luckily I thought to document this phenomenon. Here's Ian in action.</p>
