        Hello
      hello, and thank you for visiting!! I am a web developer based in New York City. I am both nerd and designer at heart. I spend most of my time coding up user interfaces and handing off compliant and pixel-perfect views for engineers to flesh out with backend functionality. Sometimes I get to create beautiful designs prior to implementing them, and sometimes I do logos and branding work that require no coding. Whatever the case is, the goal is to create an awesome web experience.
    %p
      Outside of work, I&rsquo;m an introverted yet strongly opinionated nerd. I have an elegant, graceful black cat and a loud, silly french bulldog; both incredibly adorable. I love interior design, modern and vintage furniture, the French language, and making delicious home cooked meals. I studied music performance at Carnegie Mellon University, then took up wood working, then began a masters in Design + Technology at Parsons, and now I design and code for a living and for fun. I keep busy and I get things done.

    %summary 
      I am a website developer interested in user interfaces and website implementation. Most of the sites I&rsquo;ve worked on live on the Rails framework (though these days it&rsquo;s been more Python and Tornado), in which I write web compliant views in HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript through JQuery and CoffeeScript. Due to my basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming and my personal interest in programming languages, such as Java, Ruby and Python, I feel comfortable manipulating code written by software engineers. All the while, I am a designer and creative at heart, which I express primarily through Photoshop. My design intuition and experience as a developer have made me particularly qualified to do site-wide QA testing on various platforms and operating systems. In short, I am the pixel&#45;perfect attention&#45;to&#45;detail glue between the design and backend engineering teams using my skills to facilitate and contribute to both worlds.
