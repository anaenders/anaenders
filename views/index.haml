        Work.
      For some time now, I've been working closely with engineers, first as a Front-end Engineer and Designer, and more recently as a Tech Lead and Engineering Manager. I've spent the past 5 years working at a startup, where I joined as employee #3 (they've since raised several rounds and are at 135+ employees).

      When I'm coding, my goal is to implement user interfaces and to hand off compliant and pixel-perfect templates for engineers to flesh out with backend functionality. When I'm designing, my tools of choice are Photoshop and Invision. When recruiting, I spend time vetting engineers, conducting initial phone screens and in-house interviews&mdash;I then manage many of these new hires, including interns. As a tech lead, I focus on delivering features for our consumer facing web application, working closely with product managers and various stakeholders across the company.

      I enjoy interior design, Bea Arthur ice cream cones from Big Gay Ice Cream Shop, home-made waffles, and cuddling with my clingy cat Toby and my hyperactive dog Butters while binge watching TV shows with

      I dislike the entire winter and summer seasons, waking up early, and IPAs.

      I studied music performance at Carnegie Mellon University, then took up wood working, began a Masters in Design + Technology at Parsons, and now I lead and manage full-stack engineers. I keep busy and I get things done. Check out

    %summary
      I consider myself a generalist&mdash;shifting focus to whatever the business' needs are, while being able to perform various critical roles in a fast paced environment. I split my day between managing ten people and being a team lead to our full-stack engineers. I establish code standards, perform code reviews, and I make sure the engineering team is a happy, highly functional, well-oiled machine.
