          Former frontend technologist turned people manager.<br/><br/>

          I started my career as a member of the development team at Intersect NYC working closely with the designers and software engineers, producing custom e-commerce sites and content management software.<br/><br/>
          
          I then joined The Muse, a fast-paced startup, as employee #3, initially focusing on frontend engineering and web design. In my five years with The Muse, I split my time managing half the engineering team (15 fullstack engineers) while collaborating with Engineering leads on behind-the-scences operational fun. Having established our code standards for all our SASS, I spent my days reviewing pull requests, working on product features, and hiring & managing engineers while making sure they were engaged, learning, and highly functional contributors.<br/><br/>
          
          At Spotify, I continued to focus on people management at a larger scale. In my 4 years there, I managed a total of 6 product teams across 2 organizations (the free tier optimizing the user growth funnel, i.e. acquisition > conversion > retention, and the creator studio fan first team connecting artists with their fans, and their fans with merchandise and meaningful experiences). During this time, I managed 20+ engineers (backend, data, frontend, and Android & iOS engineers) and interviewed countless others.<br/><br/>
          
          The birth of my first child in early 2020 had me rethink my priorities; I found myself shifting my focus away from my career towards parenthood. After 2 children and a 3 year hiatus, I feel excited and ready to rejoin the workforce.
